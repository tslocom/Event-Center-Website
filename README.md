# Event-Center-Website
This is a website for the fictional Vegas Expo Center for a Coding Temple Assignment
Welcome to my event center project!
I used HTML and CSS to build it, using things I've learned from Coding Temple in addition to other online resources as well as asking Gemini to teach me a couple things.
I used the transform css style on some buttons that I've seen on other sites and used the dev tools to view and recreate
We've got a calendar table and popup menu as well as a contact form and multiple images, and a back to top button at the bottom
I used a regal navy blue and gold color scheme that my fiancee helped me pick out
I hope you enjoy it!
